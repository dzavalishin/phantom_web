              <h2>Phantom Time</h2>

              <p><i>This article was written as an answer to comments to a
              <a href="https://slashdot.org/story/09/02/06/1917233/phantom-os-the-21st-century-os#comments">big SlashDot discussion</a>. 
              It was an attempt to answer a lot of questions about.
              </i></p>

              <p>&quot;The Register&quot;, &quot;OS News&quot; and &quot;Slashdot&quot; articles about Phantom OS brought
a lot of comments. Some good, some bad, some 'you are not first' ones,
and most comments show me that not a lot of people understood, what
I'm going to achieve with Pahntom. That's bad. But &ndash; some readers got
an idea, and that means hope is not lost. :)</p>

              <p>Well, generally, I'm used to it. Publishing information about Phantom
in Russia brought me nearly the same kinds of replies &ndash; from &quot;You're
idiot&quot; to &quot;it is done already&quot; to &quot;there's something&quot; to &quot;brilliant&quot;.
Most comments of the first kind (telling me that i'm idiot) later
turned to some better perception of Phantom idea. Usually it happened
after reading some of my texts about Phantom.
But &ndash; most of those texts are in Russian, and foreighn readers
can't read them due to this fact. So I decided to write this article
and try to explain in not native for me language, what and why
Phantom.</p>

              <p>The original article presented you the very basic ideas of Phantom,
and was quite correct technically &ndash; indeed, Phantom is a system with
a single huge address space, which is persistent.</p>

              <p>This is the most obvious point of Phantom and is most discussed one.
Lets look at the usual comments.</p>

              <p>People say: &quot;this is like hibernate&quot;. Of course it is not. Hibernate
is innatural for the system it saves, hibernate is to be done
manually, and, due to this fact, hibernate (and any other &quot;let's save
all memory in file&quot; solutions) can't be relied upon.</p>

              <p>You guys look at the obvious direct use of Phantom's immortality &ndash;
ability to restart your work after power loss. This is very pleasant
thing, and, possibly, main Phantom's advantage for casual user, but it
is not critical as an end user feature. You can live without it.</p>

              <p>Where immortality really rules is on programmer's side. It &ndash; excuse me
my excitement, really changes the way programmer thinks and works.</p>

              <p>Let me cite one of the comments to the original article: &quot;I can't
remember the exact figure, but it was 80% of code is devoted to
transforming data from a version useful for storage into a form useful
for processing &ndash; and vice versa.&quot;</p>

              <p>Look &ndash; 90% of programmer's work just need not to be done in Phantom!
Well, to me 90% is a bit too much &ndash; my own estimations are between 30
and 75% of code, but even 30% is really a lot. We can create software
spending 30% less money, isn't it a goal to fight for?</p>

              <p>Let me, a communist country son, show you, the capitalists, one
simple example. Imagine you can produce some car spending 30% less?
Aha? Now do you feel the money? :)</p>

              <p>Ok, so Phantom is not an attempt to wonder in the programmers' garden
of Eden, tasting one good idea and another and trying to do something
just interesting. Motivation behind Phantom is VERY straight and
practical &ndash; to build an environment which will let to produce software
in a more effective way. Faster. Easier. Cheaper. (I'm not just
programmer, I'm software company owner, I know what man&ndash;hour means how
it translates into the 'expenses' term.)</p>

              <p>Now to the second group of whinings in the comments: &quot;you're not new,
we've seen it all in 1913&quot;.</p>

              <p>And I did. I mean, I know computer world's history. Both western and
Russian. And I know it better than you, I bet. For example, do you
know that Russians created the only ternary computer in the world?
Well, hardly. Ok, lets return on the west side &ndash; do you know that
Intel created not only 286&ndash;s, but 432&ndash;s as well? I do. Not just I know
&ndash; I'm sitting in that history &quot;with a big spoon&quot;, picking the best
ideas and using them in Phantom. Nearly everything in Phantom is not
new. But carefully selected and naturally integrated.</p>

              <p>A lot of things, very good per se, can't be combined easily. Salted
cucmbers are tasty, and milk shake is tasty not less. But try to
combine them, and tell me about the results. But don't show. Please.</p>

              <p>Phantom is an attempt to select a few orthogonal principles and create
system as simple as possible, but powerful due to combinatory effect.
By the way, back in 70s, Unix was just the same &ndash; very clear and
simple combination of existing ideas, put together well. What I'm
doing is the next step in the same direction, but from today's ground.</p>

              <p>So, basically, Phantom is not about &quot;new features&quot;. It is about
cleaning old junk off the house. Once I was talking about Phantom on a
conference section, and some few hundreed young programmers were
sitting in the auditory. Talking about complexity of the nowadays
systems I asked &ndash; who knows about Windows OLE technology? Some 30
hands went up. (I suppose the other people were pure Unix guys...;)
The next question was &ndash; who really used this really handy technology
in their programs? You know what? Three guys pretended they did, and
only one of them, I think, really did. Why OLE is not used bt
programmers? Nobody needs OLE? Why &ndash; everybody needs, it is very handy
to be able to combine documents from different programs. So why OLE is
not so widespread? Because it is a real pain in the butt to work with
it. That's in Windows. In Unix &ndash; sorry, you can't even think about
this level of software integration.</p>

              <p>That is, by the way, why I say that Unix &ndash; not Linux personally, is
technologically weak. Believe me, I'm a very Unixish guy myself. Being
young programmer in 1985 I put a lot of effort bringing Unix to Soviet
Union, and I really love that elegant and simple OS. That. I mean &ndash;
K&R V7 Unix. Todays Unix is unnecessarily complex, still ugly and &ndash;
sorry &ndash; is way behind the Windows, if we're judging not only by
ability to run Apache.</p>

              <p>Lets look at the enterprise software domain. Look &ndash; everything there
is either Java running on the app server (if it is Unix) or some
Windows solution. (I simplificate a bit, sure.) So what's Unix does in
this picture? It is an app server bootloader, guys. The REAL life goes
on inside your Tomcat, or Jboss or even Websphere, god save the IBM.
Unix &ndash; as a SYSTEM &ndash; plays a very poor part in here. Like MSDOS in
90&ndash;s was a bootloader for the Doom operating system :), Unix loads app
server, and stands still aside.</p>

              <p>What is wrong with that? Just everything. First, the role of OS is to
let programs communicate, cooperate, extend eachother, play together.
Look at old Unix idea: we have 100 simple one&ndash;task text&ndash;processing
tools and can combine them to do complex and clever things. See see
the point? Having two combineable programs you can do three or four
operations. Having three &ndash; 12 or more, and so on and so on. But what
was good in 70s doesn't help today. We need to combine not just text
processing tools, and not just with pipes.</p>

              <p>One can ask &ndash; but if we already have app servers and they are good at
serving as a place for a complex programs and their combinations to
live, why new OS? Do we have it all already? Answer to this question
is above: effectiveness. If Unix, lying below the app server plays no
significant role, lets get rid of it &ndash; simple things work better. But
you need an example, you don't believe me, I susplect. :)</p>

              <p>Ok, here is one: how many context switches it is needed in unix/tomcat
pair to reply to a HTTP request? And why all these switches, if all
the app code is living in one tomcat process? And who pays for all of
them? And when you set up an ugly and wild in&ndash;kernel httpd to serve
pictures without context switches, what operating system this https
works in, and who is protecting the rest of OS from its bugs?</p>

              <p>Unix was simple and clear. Now it is cumbersome and strange. Come on,
it's time to repaint this picture from scratch. Phantom time.</p>
